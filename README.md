Finder-Icon-Overlay
===================

simple example of SIMBL plugin drawing overlays over Finder's icons.

This is a simplest possible starter. Plugin draws small, red rectangle over icons for files with filename starting with letter 'A'. Not much, but such example was highly requested. Works under Mac OS X 10.7.

There is over 16 warnings, mostly from my old and not updated Finder.h. Feel free to clean it if you're nervous about them.
